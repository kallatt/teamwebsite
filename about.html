    <h1 class="why">Coderspace</h1>
            <p class="random">Coderspace is a revolutionary 8 week program that provides minority youth with the opportunity to learn code and henceforth diversify the field. Currently in the US black technical developers make up less than 1% of all developers at prominent companies such as Facebook and Google. During the latter portion of Coderspace the students build and design a site for an outside client and gain real world experience. Just as Coderspace itself is fueled by a desire to learn and grow, our personal team (Ruth, Tyreke, Kallatt and Eden) functions so well because we all just want to succeed. </p>
    <p class="strong"> Why do we call ourselves the dream team?</p>
    <p class="random">We call ourselves the dream team because historically dream team have been teams that were made up of the best and the brightest. Additionally dream teams generally consist of complementary players which is part of what makes them so successful and
        efficient; we are a groups of coders in which all of the necessary or wanted actions can be done well by someone on the team.</p>
    <ul class="strong"> Our Strengths:</ul>
    <li class="random">Efficiency</li>
    <li class="random">Compatibility</li>
    <ul class="strong">Our weaknesses:</ul>
    <li class="random">Lack of Communication</li>
    <li class="random">We plan on improving that by working to listen to eachother and take eachothers opinions into consideration. we plan on trying to work more togather to be a true dream team.</li>
    <p class="strong">How do we work together? What are our goals?</p>
    <p class="random">As a team we tend to work together very quietly and we get a lot done, however some things that we struggled with were active listening and effective compromise. As a team our goals are to make a successful team website and to make a good website
        for the upcoming client as an extension of the work done on this website. One other major team goal is to retain what we have learned and to use those skills, coding or otherwise in our future endeavors. </p>
